UNFAIRWAY is a golf game about losing. It's a two-player game that runs entirely locally. Both players race to the hole, but every time a player *loses*, they get to pick from three upgrades. Upgrades can range from small stat boosts to powerful abilities, and the title of "most powerful player" is always moving.

## Controls

**Player 1**: `W` to move; `S` to use ability; `A` and `D` to select card

**Player 2**: `🞁` to move; `🞃` to use ability; `🞀` and `🞂` to select card (arrow keys)

To move, hold down the movement key. An arrow will start rotating around your ball. Release the movement key to 'lock in' the direction. The arrow will stop rotating, and start moving in and out, closer to and farther from your ball. Tap the movement key when the arrow is farthest from your ball to get the most momentum!

## Development

UNFAIRWAY is written in [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/). To develop UNFAIRWAY locally, just open `project.godot` in the editor.
